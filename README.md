## Code Self Potrait

### Jake Hanicak / 2-4-20

###### This is a self potrait of me blowing a bubble. All help with debugging and figureing out how to make certain shapes came from the processing refrence online - https://processing.org/reference/

###### I also used a slightly modified version of our first in class code sample (with the stoplights moving) to help me animate the bubble being blown at a slow rate and popping at a fast rate. As of now, the bubble is in a animation loop that I think activates the potrait more and brings a little more life to the piece.
